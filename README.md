# Installation

The game runs in the CLI, so you need to have a terminal to run it.
If you are on Windows and / or don't have a compiler, don't worry i got you covered ðŸ˜Ž.
Simply run the docker image with the following command:

```bash
you@debian:~$ docker compose up -d --build
you@debian:~$ docker exec -it doomsdepths bash -c "make && ./prog"
```

Otherwise, if you're truly a king and have a UNIX system ðŸ¤©, you can simply run the following command:

```bash
you@debian:~$ make && ./prog
```
